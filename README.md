# noisy-multiqubit-gates

#The open dynamics of single- and multi-qubit systems are governed by the Lindblad equation. Thus, by solving the underlying Hamiltonian including the relevant Lindblad operators for specific gates, an algorithm can be revised that simulates quantum operations incorporating Markovian noise. By integrating suitable stochastic and deterministic noise terms into the logical gate, a novel noisy gate can be manufactured replacing the exact gate. In this work, we implement such a solution for single- and two-qubit operations on both the superconducting as well as the Rydberg architecture.
